# Horiseon-Website
# This is a HTML document code for a company called Horiseon, which provides online marketing services.The document contains a header with a logo and a navigation bar, a main section that includes articles about the company's services, and an aside section that lists the benefits of using their services. There is also a footer with the company's name and copyright information.The document references external CSS and image files, which are located in the assets folder. The CSS file is used to style the content and layout of the page, while the image files are used to provide visual elements such as icons and graphics. The semantic elements in this code make the website more accessibile. It is a great experience to learn more about semantic elements. This gives an idea how to replace div elements with semantic HTML tags.
